# CODE SWIFT: Collaborative Code Editor for IT Students and Remote Developers

CODE_SWIFT is a cutting-edge, web-based collaborative code editor designed specifically for developers and IT students.
Its primary aim is to facilitate seamless teamwork among individuals working on the same codebase, regardless of their physical locations. Unlike traditional collaboration tools, CODE_SWIFT offers a range of innovative features that elevate the coding experience to new heights.

One of the standout features of CODE_SWIFT is its real-time code editing capabilities. This means that multiple users can simultaneously edit the same code file, with changes appearing instantly for all collaborators. This fosters efficient collaboration by eliminating the need for constant file sharing and manual merging of code changes.

Moreover, CODE_SWIFT takes collaboration to the next level by providing live tracking of changes through cursor movement. This allows users to see where their collaborators are working within the code in real-time, promoting better coordination and preventing conflicts.

Communication is also central to the CODE_SWIFT experience. In addition to real-time code editing, the platform offers a built-in chat option, enabling users to discuss code changes, ask questions, and share insights without having to switch between different communication tools. For more dynamic interaction, CODE_SWIFT features real-time audio calling, enabling collaborators to engage in voice conversations while working on code together. This adds a personal touch to remote teamwork and facilitates clearer communication, particularly for complex discussions or problem-solving sessions.

To ensure smooth collaboration, CODE_SWIFT includes a code conflict resolution feature. This feature helps resolve conflicts that may arise when multiple users make changes to the same code simultaneously, ensuring that the final codebase remains coherent and error-free.

Beyond its collaboration features, CODE_SWIFT is also a valuable educational resource. It offers a wealth of self-guided coding tutorials, informative blogs, and certifications in various programming languages commonly used in academic and professional settings. This makes it an invaluable tool for both learning and teaching programming concepts.

Finally, CODE_SWIFT incorporates a chatbot that provides real-time query resolution, helping users troubleshoot issues and find answers to their coding questions without leaving the platform.

In summary, CODE_SWIFT is a comprehensive solution for collaborative coding, offering a dynamic environment for remote teamwork and learning. Its innovative features and educational resources make it an invaluable tool for developers and IT students alike, facilitating efficient collaboration and skill development in academic and professional settings.

1. Navigate to the frontend (code-swift) folder:
   ```bash
   cd Code-Swift/code-swift
 - **npm init** 
 -  **npm install** 
 - **npm run dev** `(becuase this project is created using vite)`
   
--

1. Navigate to the Backend (Server) folder:
   ```bash
   cd Code-Swift/server
 - **npm init** 
 - **npm install** 
 - **npm run dev**    
--
## Default Port: 8000
